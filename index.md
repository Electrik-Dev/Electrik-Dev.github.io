## Welcome to Electrik.dev
Hello there! I am a student developer and I frequently like to try new things. This is a basic website for my development organization. 
Electrik.dev is just a place for me to put projects that are separate from school projects.

### My Projects
The following are projects that I have built

# Reddit Promotion Blocker
this project is intended to block promoted posts on Reddit. Currently found on the chrome web store and hopefully on the firefox store as well.

### Privacy Policy
As someone who takes privacy very seriously, I will never store any data on you personal, or otherwise. Any persions used by my software are used strictly because they cannot function otherwise.

### Support or Contact

I have set up an email alias so you can contact me with either feedback or issues. Because all of these projects are made on my personal time, it may take me a while to email you back but I try to do so as promptly as possible
